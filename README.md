### What I learned

This is the first frontendmentor challenge where I used sass (a css pre-processor). It is a effective tool to author and maintain css stylesheets. I enjoyed using it in this project.

### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Official website/documentation of sass pre-processor.
- [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) - A build tool like vitejs, webpack etc.
